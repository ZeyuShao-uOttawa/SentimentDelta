    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "**First diagnostic check**: Are sentiment and price movements even related?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What it measures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pearson Correlation** ($\\rho$)\n",
    "- Linear relationship strength\n",
    "- Sensitive to magnitude\n",
    "- Formula: $\\rho_{X,Y} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spearman Correlation** ($\\rho_s$)\n",
    "- Rank-based, captures nonlinear monotonic relationships\n",
    "- Robust to outliers\n",
    "- Better for detecting nonlinear patterns\n",

    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "| Correlation | Interpretation |\n",
    "|-------------|----------------|\n",
    "| ±0.00–0.05 | Negligible - No predictive value |\n",
    "| ±0.05–0.15 | Weak - Some signal present |\n",
    "| ±0.15–0.30 | Moderate - Real predictive power |\n",
    "| ±0.30+ | Strong - Highly predictive |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insight\n",
    "If Spearman > Pearson by >0.05, the relationship is **nonlinear** and better captured by tree-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 2. Ridge Regression (Economic Impact)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "**Quantify impact**: How much does each sentiment variable move prices?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_{t+1} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{sent\\_mean}_t + \\beta_2 \\text{sent\\_std}_t + \\beta_3 \\text{attention}_t + \\beta_4 \\text{bull\\_bear}_t + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $r_{t+1}$ = next-day return (%)\n",
    "- $\\beta_i$ = impact coefficient (% return per unit sentiment)\n",
    "- $\\epsilon$ = residual error\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Ridge Regression?\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: Coefficients show direct economic impact\n",
    "- **Regularization**: L2 penalty handles multicollinearity\n",
    "- **Baseline**: Linear baseline for comparison with nonlinear models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: $\\beta_{\\text{sent\\_mean}} = -0.00145$\n",
    "\n",
    "> A +1 unit increase in sentiment mean (today) is associated with a **-0.145% return (tomorrow)**, holding other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: This is correlation-based, not causal inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression tells us:\n",
    "✓ Direction of influence (positive/negative)\n",
    "✓ Relative importance of features\n",
    "✗ Nonlinear relationships\n",
    "✗ True causality\n",

    "## 3. Logistic Regression (Direction Prediction)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "**Can sentiment predict UP vs DOWN days?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{p}_{\\text{UP}} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\sum \\beta_i x_i)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Target variable:\n",
    "$$y_t = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } r_{t+1} > 0 \\text{ (UP day)} \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } r_{t+1} \\leq 0 \\text{ (DOWN day)} \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy**\n",
    "- Fraction of correct predictions\n",
    "- $\\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{TP} + \\text{TN}}{\\text{Total}}$\n",

    "**ROC AUC Score**\n",
    "- Probability that model ranks a true UP day above a DOWN day\n",
    "- Baseline: 0.50\n",
    "- Weak signal: 0.50–0.58\n",
    "- Strong signal: >0.60\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why compare both metrics?\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness\n",
    "- **AUC**: Ranking quality (useful for portfolio construction)\n",

    "## 4. Random Forest Classifier (Nonlinear Effects)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "**Do sentiment effects involve interactions or nonlinear relationships?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Specification\n",
    "- **N trees**: 300\n",
    "- **Max depth**: 5 (prevents overfitting)\n",
    "- **Train/test split**: 70/30 (time-aware)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "1. Bootstrap samples from training data\n",
    "2. For each sample, grow a decision tree (random feature selection)\n",
    "3. Predict by averaging predictions across all trees\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detecting Nonlinear Effects\n",

    "| Comparison | Interpretation |\n",
    "|-----------|----------------|\n",
    "| RF Accuracy ≈ Logistic | Linear effects dominate |\n",
    "| RF Accuracy >> Logistic | Nonlinear interactions present |\n",
    "| RF AUC >> Logistic AUC | Tree model captures important patterns |\n",

    "---\n",

    "## 5. Lagged Returns (Control Variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "**Isolate sentiment effect from price momentum**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Control for Past Returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Markets exhibit **autocorrelation**: past returns predict future returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without lagged returns in the model:\n",
    "- Sentiment appears more predictive than it actually is\n",
    "- Model captures momentum, not sentiment signal\n",
    "- Overstates predictive power\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Add 3 lags of returns:\n",
    "$$r_{t+1} = f(\\text{sent}_t, r_{t-1}, r_{t-2}, r_{t-3})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "If sentiment remains significant after adding lags:\n",
    "> Sentiment contains information **beyond price momentum**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Granger Causality Test\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "**Does sentiment causally predict returns?** (Econometric test)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis Test\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null hypothesis (H₀)**\n",
    "> Sentiment does **not** improve price prediction beyond past returns alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Models Compared\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model 1 (Returns only)**\n",
    "$$r_t = c + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\alpha_i r_{t-i} + u_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model 2 (Returns + Sentiment)**\n",
    "$$r_t = c + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\alpha_i r_{t-i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\gamma_j \\text{sent}_{t-j} + u_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F = \\frac{(\\text{RSS}_1 - \\text{RSS}_2) / q}{\\text{RSS}_2 / (n - k)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- RSS = residual sum of squares\n",
    "- q = number of restrictions (sentiment lags)\n",
    "- p-value computed from F-distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "| p-value | Conclusion |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|\n",
    "| < 0.05 | Reject H₀: Sentiment **does** Granger-cause returns |\n",
    "| > 0.05 | Fail to reject: No evidence of causality |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Clarification\n",
    "- **Granger causality ≠ true causality**\n",
    "- Means: sentiment provides **incremental forecasting power**\n",
    "- Does not mean: sentiment directly causes price changes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 7. Volatility (Range) Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "**Does sentiment affect price uncertainty, not just direction?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{range}_{t+1} = \\frac{\\text{High}_{t+1} - \\text{Low}_{t+1}}{\\text{Open}_{t+1}}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why Volatility Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment often impacts:\n",
    "- **Disagreement** among traders (pushes prices wider)\n",
    "- **Uncertainty** (increases bid-ask spreads)\n",
    "- **Trading activity** (higher volume = larger moves)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finding**: Volatility effects often **stronger** than return effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta_{\\text{sent\\_std}} = +0.0032$\n",
    "\n",
    "> Higher sentiment disagreement (today) → +0.32% intraday range (tomorrow)\n",

    "### Purpose\n",
    "**Is the signal real or just random noise?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question\n",
    "> If sentiment were completely random, how often would we observe an effect this strong?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**: Compute real effect\n",
    "- Train: $r_{t+1} = \\beta \\cdot \\text{sent}_t + \\epsilon$\n",
    "- Record: $\\beta_{\\text{real}}$\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **No single model answers all questions** - Use multiple models for triangulation\n",
    "2. **Correlation ≠ prediction** - Correlation is necessary but not sufficient\n",
    "3. **Control for momentum** - Lagged returns are critical control variables\n",
    "4. **Nonlinearity matters** - Compare linear vs tree-based model performance\n",
    "5. **Validate everything** - Monte Carlo testing separates signal from noise\n",
    "6. **Multi-ticker consensus** - Real signals should generalize across stocks\n",
    "7. **Trading signals require multiple confirmations** - Not just one model\n",
    "8. **Volatility often stronger than returns** - Consider both dimensions\n",
    "9. **Granger ≠ causality** - Means \"predictive precedence\" only\n",
    "10. **Results are probabilistic** - All models capture associations, not absolute truths"
